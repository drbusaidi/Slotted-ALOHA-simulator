# Slotted-ALOHA-simulator
Slotted ALOHA protocol simulator use python
Slotted ALOHA was brought in 1972 as an improvement to pure ALOHA. The time in the case of slotted ALOHA is divided into discrete intervals called slots that correspond to a frame. Here, slotted ALOHA overcomes the possibility of frame hitting in pure ALOHA. Unlike pure ALOHA, this type of ALOHA does not allow data transmission whenever the station wants to send it. 

If a station wants to send the frame to a shared channel, frames can only be sent at the beginning of the slot. Only one frame is allowed to be sent to every slot. In case the station fails to send data, it will have to wait till the next slot. Still, there is a possibility of collision in case two stations try to send a frame at the beginning of the time slot
